# NBSINFRA_CLPrague-ABM
The Prague model applies the RSQF to Dejvice University Campus, using agent-based simulation to assess NBS (green roofs, permeable pavements, biodetention). It aims to reduce the Urban Heat Island effect, enhance urban resilience, and improve biodiversity, water management, and community attractiveness, particularly under heatwave conditions.
