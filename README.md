# NBSINFRA_CLPrague-ABM
The Prague model is a specific application of the Resilience and Sustainability Quantification Framework that focuses on the Dejvice University Campus in Prague, Czech Republic. Its primary goal is to evaluate the performance of Nature-Based Solutions within the local green infrastructure network, particularly at the building scale, to mitigate the Urban Heat Island effect and enhance urban resilience.
The key aspects of the Prague model include the following:
Case Study Area: the Dejvice University Campus provides a robust urban environment with a mix of pervious and impervious surfaces, buildings, green spaces, and a vibrant community. This setting allows for the evaluation of multifaceted NBS impacts on urban resilience and sustainability.
NBS Interventions: the model assesses various NBS, including bioswales and rain gardens, green facades and walls, green roofs, increased tree canopy cover, and permeable pavements. It also explores integrated solutions, such as combining tree canopy cover and permeable pavements.
Ecosystems and Focus Areas: the evaluation aims to quantify the contribution of these solutions to urban resilience against UHI effects across several metrics, including air cooling, water savings, biodiversity, and local community attraction.
Modeling Framework: the model is configured as a 3D prismatic arrangement (93x101x6 patches), where each 7x7x7 meter cubic patch represents specific urban elements like buildings, impervious surfaces, green areas, or air. Dynamic elements include diverse vegetation agents (trees, bushes, riparian species) and human agents (pedestrians, community clusters), whose movements and behaviors interact with the environment and NBS.
Simulation Procedures: the simulation incorporates fundamental aspects such as water balance (surface runoff, soil retention), vegetation growth dynamics (soil fertility, coverage, floral diversity), microclimate regulation (air cooling effect, air quality), and human satisfaction/comfort. Procedures for soil water retention, vegetation status assessment, and floral diversity (using the Shannon index) are implemented. Microclimate regulation, particularly air cooling and air quality, is quantified using established methodologies like the Air Quality Impact Index. Human agents' behaviors, such as seeking green spaces and avoiding paved surfaces or extreme heat, are also modeled.
Scenarios: the model explores various NBS design alternatives against a 'do nothing' baseline (A0) under normal climate conditions. Crucially, it also rigorously evaluates the impact of all NBS alternatives under simulated heatwave conditions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of their resilience-enhancing capabilities during extreme climatic events.
Assessment: the assessment involves a comparative analysis of the NBS alternatives' effectiveness under normal and heatwave conditions, focusing on soil water retention capacity, vegetation status, biodiversity, air quality, community attractiveness, and Ecosystem Service Values (regulating, provisioning, and cultural). The analysis highlights that while NBS generally enhance urban resilience, their effectiveness varies significantly based on type, scale, and integration, with integrated approaches often showing superior performance. For example, alternative A4 (tree canopy cover) significantly improves air quality, while A1 (bioswales/raingardens) enhances soil water retention. Heatwaves can reduce the effectiveness of some NBS, particularly impacting community satisfaction and air quality, though provisioning services often remain substantial even under stress. The findings emphasize the need for robust NBS strategies that perform well under both normal and extreme conditions.
